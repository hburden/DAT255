# Schedule Project Handoff

Please add your group number to a `Free` slot. Please leave the slots marked `Spare` to groups that require a specific day. If possible, fill up days before you start another (if the day does not matter to you).

Each group will have about 30 minutes to present, so a new slot will begin every 45 minutes (setup time, etc). So, The first group starts at 13:15, the second at 14:00, the third at 14:45, etc.
