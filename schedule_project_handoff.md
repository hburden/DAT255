# Schedule Project Handoff

Please add your group number to a `Free` slot. Please leave the slots marked `Spare` to groups that require a specific day. If possible, fill up days before you start another (if the day does not matter to you).

Each group will have about 15 minutes to present. Try to use 10 mins for presentation and leave 5 mins for questions. You presentation should focus on:

- What does your app do?
- What makes it special?
- What design decisions did you make?
- How did you work?
- What did you learn?

Note that the schedule is very tight, so please be as prepared as possible (test your equipment, make sure you only need 10 mins, etc.)
