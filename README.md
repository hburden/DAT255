# Course PM for DAT256 Software Engineering Project 7.5 HEC, Autumn 2018

## News

## Course description
The course consists of two phases. The first phase consists of two weeks and is used to introduce the course topics through lectures and exercises. During the first week the students are expected to form a scrum development team. The second phase consists of six-seven weeks and centres around weekly supervision. During this phase the teams work together to develop applications for a specific purpose. Through guest lectures the students are given the opportunity to reflect on how their own work relates to what professional software engineers do and to put their own experiences into a bigger picture. The second phase finishes with a final presentation the week before the examination week. The examination week can then be used to write the final reflection and other relevant documentation needed for signing off. 

The majority of the course work is done in project teams. The topic this time is Android apps within the automotive domain. The case will be introduced during the second week of the course.

## Learning outcomes
In this course you will learn how to design and develop software, and to manage projects:
- Knowledge and understanding, the student should be able to:
	- describe software engineering uses appropriate terminology
	- describe the relationship between stakeholders, process and product

- Skills and abilities, the student should be able to:
	- specify, implement and evaluate
	- learn how to use project-relevant tools and APIs together with their peers
	- apply a structured development process as part of a team

- Judgement and approach, the student should be able to:
  	- reflect over how the development process was applied in the project
	- reflect over both the own and the team's learning strategies

Since a substantial part of the work is conducted in teams, please consider the [Chalmers rules regarding your work conditions][CRS]. If you encounter problems, contact a course teacher immediately!

## Examination
The assessment is done on both individual and team level. The assessment is done in terms of reflecting on pre-defined topics. Smith states that reflection is "assessment of what is in relation to what might or should be and includes feedback designed to reduce the gap" (R. Smith, *Formative Evaluation and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning*, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, vol. 88, 2001, pp. 51-62) which can be boiled down to describing ...  
... the current situation (A),  
... what you want the situation to be (B), and  
... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be (A -> B).

Each step is worth one point per topic, so that the maximum points for a topic is 3. But you can only score a point for a step if you received a point for the previous step(s). This means you get 0 points for only describing where you want to be since you don't have a point for describing the current situation. That also means that you can not reflect in week n if you have not recorded a reflection for week n-1, since this means that the chain of reflection is broken. We will only assign points to the last iteration (week 9) which should summarise and synthesise the learning from the previous iterations ("what is"), describe what you would like to do in a similar future project ("what might or should be") and how you can make the change come true ("feedback designed to reduce the gap").

As an individual you will upload a text document to the team repository where you each week reflect on the following questions
- what do I want to learn or understand better?
- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

As a team you should reflect on the following topics:
- the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week 
- the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
- your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
- the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)
- the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
- the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
- your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
- the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress
- code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself
- the roles you have used within the team 
- the agile practices you have used for the current sprint
- the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
- the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
- best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
- relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)

The total for the team is then 16*3 = 48 but each team gets two additional points if all team members have completed their individual reflections, so that the total = 50.
The team grade is then computed so that a total score within the range 
00 - 20 = U (fail)
21 - 30 = 3 or G (pass)
31 - 40 = 4
41 - 50 = 5 or VG (pass w. distinction)

The individual grade is then based on the individual reflections, the outcome of analysing the contribution towards the team repository (for instance by [gitinspector][GitInspector]) and the outcome of the [peer assessment][PeerAssessment]. If the team has been awarded a grade for the course and there is a weekly individual reflection the grade of each team member can then be lowered or raised if both repository analysis and the peer assessment indicate a difference of 25% or more compared to the team mean. This means that in a team of six team members, receiving the team grade 4 where someone is responsible for 20% of the code and scored 14 out of 20 on the peer assessment, will get the individual grade 5. Conversely, a team of six with the team grade 3 where a team member committed 5% of the code and scored a mean of 7 out of 20 from peer assessment, will be failed.

We strive for a transparent and fair assessment strategy. [That is why we as teachers are the ones that do the grading based on our experience][fairgrades].
